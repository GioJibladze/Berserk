                    <p>Today we will be reviewing the anime Berserk 1997. The popular manga by legendary mangaka Kentaro Miura has been animated many times, but it is the 1997 version that stands out as the best adaptation to date. The story follows Guts, a lone mercenary who encounters a group of mercenaries called the Band of the Hawk.</p>
                    
                    <p>Their charismatic leader Griffith convinces him to join them after besting him in a duel twice. As Griffith drives the Hawks towards his dreams will Guts realise his own or will tragedy strike? At least it is true that man has no control, even over his own will.</p>

                        <p>Guts is a character that is heavily associated with grim culture and brand of sacrifice tattoos these days, but there is so much more to his character. Born from the womb of his dead mother, Guts was cursed from the very moment he drew breath from this world. As his life continued, every moment of ease was just another tragedy in disguise waiting to happen. Guts has no vision of a future but he still continues to fight.</p>
                        
                        <p>Why is that? After meeting the band of the Hawk and Griffith, he temporarily found a place of belonging but this once again turned into another painful lesson. Do bonds make us weaker and cause us nothing but pain in the long run or is Guts just simply unlucky? Guts has suffered more than most anime characters but he still shows resilience and digs deep whenever faced with an impossible trial.</p>
                        
                        <p>His nihilistic mindset doesn't stop him from fighting and protecting those around him. Guts isn't a good man but he still tries his best to do what is right, like so many of us today.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><em>A 9.6 for my second favourite anime character of all time! I could honestly talk about Guts for hours and write a much more in depth analysis of him but that's for another day. Guts provides alot of us hope in a twisted kind of way. He allows the readers to see that no matter how bad it gets, there is still a reason to keep fighting...even if we may not know what that reason is in the moment itself.</em></p>

Beautiful, charismatic, and utterly ruthless in pursuit of his dream, Griffith embodies the dangerous allure of absolute ambition. His relationship with Guts forms the emotional core of the series - a bond of friendship, rivalry, and ultimately betrayal that defines both characters.</p>
                        
                        <p>What makes Griffith truly terrifying isn't his power, but his humanity.

The Eclipse stands as one of the most shocking moments in anime history, where Griffith's true nature is finally revealed.</p>

                        <p>Corkus represents the ambitious commoner who dreams of rising above his station. As one of the original members of the Band of the Hawk, he's fiercely loyal to Griffith but harbors deep resentment toward Guts, whom he sees as a threat to his position and dreams of nobility.</p>
                        
                        <p>His character serves as a mirror to common human flaws - jealousy, ambition, and the desire for recognition. While often abrasive and petty, Corkus's motivations are ultimately understandable. He represents the everyman caught up in extraordinary circumstances.</p>
                        
                        <p>Despite his flaws, Corkus's loyalty to the Hawks and his genuine belief in Griffith's dream make him a complex character rather than a simple antagonist.</p>
